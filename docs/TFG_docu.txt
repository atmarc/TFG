 
The aim of the project is to study the properties of quantum particles in an external field reproducing a fractal structure. A possible realization is an ultracold quantum gas confined to two dimensions with a superimposed external field, which will create the fractal geometry. As a model for the fractal, we will consider Sierpi¿ski carpet. The main properties of interest in the ground state energy and the density profile. Such properties are to be calculated as a function of the recursion number and a possible existence of a simple scaling law has to be verified.


This interdisciplinary problem is based on application of mathematical concepts to the field of quantum physics and relies on use of numerical methods. This project requires carrying out a scientific investigation and a priori it is not clear which method will work the best. In particular, possible  approaches to address the problem are
1) to solve Schrödinger equation in imaginary time for one particle
2) to solve Gross-Pitaevskii equation to solve Schroedinger equation in imaginary time for many bosons
3) do exact diagonalization of a discretized Hamiltonian for one particle and few fermions
4) random walks solution for the diffusion equation (i.e. Schroedinger equation in imaginary time) for one particle
