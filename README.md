# Quantum particles in fractalexternal potential

This is the repository of my final degree thesis (TFG in catalan). It contains all the Matlab programs and some data (not sorted, sorry) that I present on my thesis `report.pdf`.
## Thesis abstract
The Schr√∂dinger equation gives us a time evolution of the wave function of a certain quantum system, thus we obtain a mathematical description of this system. This project focuses on solving it numerically, using the exact diagonalization method.

We present an algorithm to solve the time-independent version of the equation efficiently for a particle in a box with different boundary conditions, and a second program that performs a quantum superposition of the stationary states previously computed to obtain the time evolution of the wave function.

Using these two programs, we ran several simulations to obtain the properties of a quantum system exposed to an external potential with a fractal shape. The selected two-dimensional fractal was the Sierpinski carpet.

An analysis of the static and dynamic properties was performed, and we corroborated the existence of an exponential scaling law between the ground-state energy and the iteration of the fractal. We also verified the expected diffusive behavior over time of the mean squared displacement of a particle under this fractal shaped potential.

Our work can be extended by using the presented programs to perform more experiments with different parameters or different external potential shapes. The program can also be fine-tuned to solve other kind of systems.
